# dice-roll-simulator
he Dice Roll Simulator is a simple Python project that simulates the rolling of a die. When the program runs, it randomly generates a number between 1 and 6, representing the face of a standard six-sided die. It provides users with the option to roll the die multiple times, making it interactive and engaging. This project is a great way for beginners to practice basic programming concepts such as random number generation, conditional statements, loops, and user input handling. It can also be extended to include graphical output or support for dice with a different number of sides.
